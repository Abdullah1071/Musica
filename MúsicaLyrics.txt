hollywood's bleeding|

hollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
darkness turns to dust
everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
nobody left but us
tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
ridin' on the last train home
dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
we only make it out alone
i just keep on hopin' that you call me
you say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
you never took the time to get to know me
was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
we're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
yeah, hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home
outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
city up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
in the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
she gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
it seem like dying young is an honor
but who'd be at my funeral? i wonder
i go out, and all they eyes on me
i show out, do you like what you see?
and now they closin' in on me
let 'em sharpen all they teeth
this is more than i can handle
blood in my lambo'
wish i could go, oh, i'm losin' ho-ope
i light a candle, some palo santo
for all these demons, wish i could just go on
i just keep on hopin' that you call me
you say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
you never took the time to get to know me
was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
we're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
yeah, hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home

i'm still waiting wide awake for the waves to come and take
take me right to you (take me right to you)
one hundred vials of denial i know they won't bring you back

i remember back then
played my cards right you were my best hand
still you keep me guessing
wonder will i ever get the message
say my prayers but i lost faith a long time ago
dream nightmares
i guess we're getting used to losing hope
i don't even wanna know why you don't answer

there's creatures who are hiding in the dark
then something came creeping
it told her, don't you worry just

all we know
left untold
beaten by a broken dream
nothing like what it used to be (used to be)
we've been chasing our demons down an empty road
been watching our castle turning into dust
escaping our shadows just to end up here
once more
and we both know
this is not the world we had in mind
but we got time
we are stuck on answers we can't find
but we got time
and even though we might have lost tonight
the skyline reminds us of a different time
this is not the world we had in mind
but we got time
broken smile, tired eyes
i can feel your longing heart
call my name, howling from afar
we've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat
been building a castle just to watch it fall
been running forever just to end up here
once more
and now we know
this is not the world we had in mind
but we got time
we are stuck on answers we can't find
but we got time
and even though we might have lost tonight
the skyline reminds us of a different time
this is not the world we had in mind
but we got time
take me back
back to the mountainside
under the northern lights
chasing the stars
take me back
back to the mountainside
when we were full of life
back to the start
and we both know that
this is not the world we had in mind
but we got time

you cross that line and it's time to say f you
what's the point in saying that when you know how i'll react?
you think you can just take it back, but shit just don't work like that

diamonds don't shatter
beautiful and battered
into the poison
cry you an ocean

goodbye, so long
i don't know if this is right or wrong
am i giving up where i belong?
'cause every station is playing our song
goodbye my love

you'll be prince and i'm the crying dove
if i only were unbreakable
i wish that i did not know
where all broken lovers go

with careless melodies
something buried deep inside us
the major and the minor
we're like piano keys
you played for me

i swear it, even in my sleep
i hear it like the memory
of everything we used to be
you played for me

we couldn't stop the world from turning
it was like a whirlwind
scattered us like leaves
but i'm stuck inside a feeling
the song that never leaves
we were like a symphony
you played for me
you played for me, oh-oh
you played for me
i swear it, even in my sleep
i hear it like the memory
of everything we used to be

i have seen
all of your remedies
now won't you let me please go home.
i can't find anything to be sad about.
they say i'm doomed but i feel fine.
i have tried
so very hard as hell
to stay away from them
and live upstairs.
when i see
all of your remedies
i try quite desperately to go home.
i can't find anythin' to be sad about.
they say i'm doomed but i feel fine.
but if i'm seating here lonely,
with no one to hold me,
at least i'll have my health.
i'm tryin' to control myself.

|the never saga|

the family life it was divine
she sat alone with tired eyes
patiently listening to the sighs
i found out
i found out
she never has the time
i found out
to make his demons
they snatched her willingly she left
they wondered why she'd accepted that
she knew that she'd be saved but how
she knew that future kid was on the prowl
i found out
i found out
we could both run wild
i found out
me and future's child
i found out
i found out
we could both run wild
i found out
me and future's child
i found out
never's far too long
for me to sing this song

|this love|

i was so high, i did not recognize
the fire burning in her eyes
the chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
never to return again
but always in my heart
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore, woah, woah, woah
i tried my best to feed her appetite
keep her coming every night
so hard to keep her satisfied
oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
pretending to feel the same
then turn around and leave again
but, oh, this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
and her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore woah, woah, woah
i'll fix these broken things
repair your broken wings
and make sure everything is alright
my pressure on your hips
sinking my fingertips
into every inch of you
'cause i know that's what you want me to do
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
my heart is breaking in front of me
she said goodbye too many times before
this love has taken its toll on me
she said goodbye too many times before
her heart is breaking in front of me
i have no choice 'cause i won't say goodbye anymore

|sleepy windbreaker|

we filled the day with careless displays
going sailing with nothing to say
when i fell
we could tell
now you're torn apart
the sun's driving fast
taking photographs
it's morning at last
and the sailors are taking a stand
with their heads buried deep in the sand
feeling well
life is swell
when i fell
we could tell
hooray
when i fell
we could tell
feeling well
life is swell

the wind blows
your mind falls down
just give me
the time to drown
the wind blows
your mind falls down
just give me
the time to drown
the boys are
digging the ground
but i can't
stop spinning around
some day you will let me be
what i wanted you to be
the boys are
stopping the ground
from taking
those things we found
someday she will let me see
all of the things we used to see
one day you will let me be
what i wanted you to be
one day she will let me be
the champ she wanted her to see

|my ocean blue|

i once heard captain dan tell me a story
about this lovely girl who's name was jane
she was vast and deep and filled with glory
ah
bottom served as home for hull and anchor
she's always fit to quarrel with the wind
the great titanic yes it's she that sank her
ah
then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear
i love you
my ocean blue
i like the way your sea sees me
my darling jane
she speaks to me at times through falling rain
now twas time to manifest her vigor
was she fit to quarrel with the wind?
the air was strong but jane she was much bigger
ah
then she heard me
say that oath that
made everything clear
i love you
my ocean blue
i like the way your sea sees me
my darling jane
oh me, my darling jane
oh me and my darling jane
she speaks to me at times through falling rain
speaks to me at times through falling rain

|captain splendid|

nobody cares
about ocean affairs
he's by himself 'cause nobody loves him
cleaning his sand
filled boots with his hand
looking for something but nothing sees him
happy was he
in spite of his knee
that wasn't there because of his day job
there was a man
who took to the band
paying attention tried to adhere him
and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled finding a plan
seemingly fine
he slipped on his wine
terra was healthy but not on a mission
there was a sea
a mythical tease
our cannons were shot
"til we couldn't afford them
others would have died alone
angels all worked free
timeless fairs and sing-alongs
speaking naturally
and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
all the way
from the bay
i could hear them say
all the time
we were dead
and i'm cap' splendid
and he ran
and he shot
but his rivals were sharp
and the kids
in the sand
struggled deep hand in hand
all the way
from the bay
i could hear them say
i don't care
if we're dead
and i'm cap splendid
